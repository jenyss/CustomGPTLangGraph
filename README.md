# Custom GPT based on LangGraph with Search and Summarization Tools

This Assistant processes company documents and provides precise answers with citations. It supports PDFs, text files, Word, and Excel, extracting content and storing vector embeddings in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval. When a user asks a question, it performs a similarity search, retrieves the most relevant snippets, and ensures responses are grounded in documented sources.

## How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ Document Ingestion & Embedding (One-Time Process)

üìÇ **Supported Formats**: PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX  
* Extracts text from documents while preserving metadata (e.g., source, page number).  
* Splits text into chunks using **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** (supports various separators).  
* Converts text chunks into vector embeddings using **OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-3-large** model.  
* Stores embeddings in **ChromaDB**, ensuring documents are easily searchable.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Query Processing (Every Time a User Asks a Question)

üîç When a user asks something, the `search_docs(query)` function:  
* Converts the query into an embedding.  
* Performs **similarity search** in ChromaDB.  
* Retrieves the **top-k most relevant document chunks**.  
* Extracts relevant snippets from the retrieved content.  
* Returns results with **citations** (document name & page number).  

3Ô∏è‚É£ AI Assistant Handles User Queries

ü§ñ **Built with GPT-4o** and follows strict response guidelines:  
* Queries the **SearchDocsTool** first before answering.  
* Uses the **SummarizationTool** for high-level overviews.  
* Provides **precise responses with citations** (no hallucinated information).  
* If no relevant documents are found, it explicitly states: *"I don't have sufficient documentation to answer this question accurately."*

## Intallation

<b>Prerequisites</b>

* Access to <b>JupyterLab, Google Colab</b>, or another interactive computing environment to run this Jupyter Notebook.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd <PROJECT_FOLDER>
```

### Step 2: Open Jupyter Notebook in JupyterLab

Ensure that ```<PROJECT_FOLDER>``` is accessible in JupyterLab by setting it as your working directory in JupyterLab.
 * In JupyterLab, use the "Open from Path" option to load ```CustomGPTLangGraph.ipynb```.
 * Similarly, load ```.env``` and populate the variable keys with appropriate values.
 * The first cell in the Notebook installs the required libraries: **pip install langchain_experimental PyMuPDF langchain langgraph chromadb openai python-dotenv langchain-chroma**

### Step 3: Run the Jupyter Notebook

To execute the notebook, select each cell and press ```Shift + Enter```.
